        <h2> 1. Software!!</h2>
        <p> ------------</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h2> Software!!</h2>
            </li>
            <p>We call software the set of programs, documentation and data closely related in order to make up a
                computer application. Software development requires the creation of a software project, and a group of
                people working in a coordinated way. Besides,
                software does not break along time, although its performance can be reduced because of its own updates
                and improvements.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Programs: sets of instructions that provide the desired functionality. They are written in a
                    specific programming language.</li>
                <li>Data: programs need data to work with. These data can be retrieved and/or stored from/in databases
                    or files.</li>
                <li>Documentation: software documents explain how to use it, which elements are part of it and how they
                    are interconnected, so that it can be updated or fixed in the future.</li>
            </ul>

                <h3> Software types </h3>
            </li>

            <ul>
                <li>Application software: they bring some kind of service to the customer, such as text processors,
                    spreadsheets, drawing</li>
                <li>System software: they manage a computer system. They are basically programs that support or help
                    other programs. </li>
                <li>Hola estoy buscando ayuda para ir al cine al lado de la casa de paco el que es opaco poruqe cada vez que voy me cagan a batazos y pues estoy cansado
                    y quiero ir con toda la banda a darles bruscas muestras de amor incondicional. Gracias.</li>
            </ul>

        </ol>

        <h2> 2. Languages and compilers</h2>
        <p> ------------</p>

        <p>The programing languages are used to provide instructions to a computer. After choosing a programming
        language we can create a source code. </p>

        <h3> 2.1 </h3>
        <p> There are two types of programming languages, a high level and low low level languages. High level languages  are more understanble by the programmers, but the low level ones are closer to a machine code, meaningharder to understand.</p>

        <p> Some examples of high level languages are: C, C++, C#, Java, Javascript, PHP, etc. </p>
        <p> And the low level one is the assembly language </p>

        <h3> 2.2 </h3>
        <p> We have to use a compiler in order to translate the programing language into a machine code. There are some different language processors that can be used, depending on the language itself:</p>

        <p>Compilers: create an executable file with the translation of the programing language into machine code
         Interpreters: translate from the specified programming language to machine code
        </p>

        <p> Virtual machine: is an operating system or application environment that is
            installed on software, which imitates dedicated hardware. The end user has the
            same experience on a VM as they would on dedicated hardware.</p>




        <h2> 3. Some popular languages</h2>
        <p> ------------</p>

        <p> There are some studies and analysis that try to classify the programming languages according to its
            popularity or current usage. Some of the most popular ones are: </p>

        <ul>
            <li> <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">TIOBE index </a> </li>
            <li> <a href=" https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2021/03/01/language-rankings-1-21/"> RedMonk ranking </a>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p> Regarding this last one, it is based on crossing data between the main source code repository (GitHub)
            and the main programming help page (StackOverflow </p>
