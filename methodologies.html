    <h3>1.1 Stages in software development</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Requirements analysis:</strong> his stage includes the communication with the customer to clarify his needs, and an analysis stage to sketch out the main behaviour of the application</li>
        <ul>
           <li>Requirements specification: the communication with the customer, in which we will arrange some interviews or other ways of getting information</li> 
           <li>Analysis:from the requirements specification created in previous stage, we must now create a new document where we will use some helpful diagrams to represent the main functionalities </li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Design:</strong> from the analysis documents set before, we can now determine how the software will work</li>
        <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> this stage should be started from previous design stage, using a specific programming language</li>
        <li><strong>Testing</strong>once the product has been implemented, we must test it to check if it fulfills all the requirements and there is no bug</li>
        <li><strong>Maintenance</strong> this last stage consists in improving the performance of the software product, by adding new extensions, or fixing some bug</li>
    </ol>

            <li><h3>1. Software lifecycles</h3></li>
            <li>A lifecycle is a list of stages through which a system (in this case, a software project) must go, from its birth until it is no longer used. In each lifecycle we set both the stages and the requirements to go from one stage to the next, including the inputs and outputs expected for every stage.

                The products generated after each stage are called deliverables and they are either part of the input of the next stage or an evaluation of the project at a given point.
                
                Some lifecycles are repetitive, this is, we can go through the same stage more than once, depending on the state of the product. This process is also known as feedback.
                
                We are going to see some of the most typical lifecycles in software development, and their pros and cons. In all of them we will find the stages seen before (requirements analysis, design, implementationâ€¦), or any variation of them.</li>
