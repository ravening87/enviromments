        Version control systems (VCS) are tools that can register any change in any file or set of files 
        over time, so that we can easily recover any older version. 
        They can be used not only with source files, but also with any other file type.
        A VCS lets us revert the state of any file or even of a whole project,and compare files over time, determine who changed the file at a given timestamp and much more.
        Besides, if any file gets damaged or lost, we can just go back to a previous version in history and recover it again.

    <li>1.1. VCS types: Local VCS</li>
    <p>
     VCS can be used either online or in local mode. This last mode is particularly useful because we can easily create a backup of a project and store it locally, 
     so that we can restore it later if we need to (in case of an error, for instance) and go back to a stable version.
     The main advantage of this is its simplicity, and the main drawback is that we must manage the version control manually, 
     so we may make some mistakes in this process. For instance, we must forget that we are in the wrong folder, and then modify the backup file instead of the current one.
     In order to face these problems, there are some interesting tools that help us manage the files and changes. One of the most popular ones is a system called rcs,
     which can still be found in many computers. This tool basically stores a set of patches or differences between files from one version to the next one. 
     These changes are stored in a special file type, and then the system can recover any previous state of any file, by adding or substracting the corresponding patches.</p>
