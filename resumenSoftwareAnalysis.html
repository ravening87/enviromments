        <h2>1. Origin of the project</h2>
        <p>Regarding the origin of the idea, it can come from:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The compamy itself, as one of its internal developments.</li>
            <li>An external entity/company which asks this company to develop the product.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In both cases, we must have a clear overview of the product to be developed, and evaluate its viability.</p>

        <h2>3. Gathering requirements</h2>
        <p>The first stage in the software development process is the requirements analysis, which is divided into 2 subtasks:
            requirements specifications and software analysis.</p>
        <p>communication with costumer is an essential part of the decision-making process</p>
        <p>Drawbacks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Developers don't know what custoemr exactly wants</li>
            <li>Customer doesn't know what type of information is relevant for developers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Solutions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identify relevant source of information</li>
            <li>Ask the apropiate questions</li>
            <li>Check answers with customer</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Interviews</li>
            <li>Joint aplication development (JAD)</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Interviews</h2>
            <p>Not just asking questions, it needs to be structured/guided.</p>
            <p>Stages</p>
